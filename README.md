Java Spring Boot Project
📖 Overview
This is a Java Spring Boot project showcasing a robust backend application built with Spring Boot, designed for scalability, maintainability, and ease of development. The project serves as a template for building RESTful APIs, integrating with databases, and implementing modern software engineering practices.
🚀 Features

RESTful APIs: Well-structured endpoints for CRUD operations.
Database Integration: Supports MySQL or PostgreSQL for data persistence.
Dependency Injection: Leverages Spring's IoC container for modular code.
Security: Configured with Spring Security for authentication and authorization (optional).
API Documentation: Integrated with Swagger/OpenAPI for easy API exploration.
Testing: Unit and integration tests using JUnit and Mockito.
Configuration: Environment-based configuration with application.properties or application.yml.

🏃‍♂️ Getting Started
1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/TuanViDev/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name

2. Configure the Database
Update the src/main/resources/application.properties or application.yml with your database credentials:
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/your_database
spring.datasource.username=your_username
spring.datasource.password=your_password
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update

3. Build the Project
mvn clean install

4. Run the Application
mvn spring-boot:run

The application will start on http://localhost:8080.
5. Access Swagger UI
Open your browser and navigate to:
http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html
